Knative (pronounced kay-nay-tiv) extends Kubernetes to provide a set of middleware
components that are essential to build modern, source-centric, and container-based
applications that can run anywhere: on premises, in the cloud, or even in a third-party
data center.

The Knative project attempts to identify common patterns and
codify the best practices that are shared by successful real-world Kubernetes-based frameworks and
applications.

Developers on Knative can use familiar idioms, languages, and frameworks to deploy any workload: functions, applications, or containers.
